# Amadeus

This is the project motivated by Amadeus APP which appears in "Steins-gate".

I implemented chatbot using transformer model and provide the whole code + android application source code.

If you are a programmer who are willing to develop own chatbot, get the code and freely modify it!

# Requirements for development

will be described later.

The structure of the project is very simple. 

There are one chatbot server and one android client (= android application). 

When you activate the android application on your phone (or android studio) and enter chatting room, android client start to connect with chatbot server.

If you click the send button, the text you typed will go to chatbot server. Then, the AI module in the chatbot server produce a answer text according to your text.

The answer text go to your android application.

Finally, you can see what AI answered on your phone.
